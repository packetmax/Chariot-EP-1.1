To connect right click on "arduino-chat-frontend-logo" and open with Google Chrome or Firefox. A websocket connection will
be attempted, by way of a popup screen. If your Arduino/Ethernet/Chariot stack is operating with a different IP address
(i.e., not 192.168.0.77--the default for the Websocket library), you can change it in the popup or simply edit the
javascript file.
